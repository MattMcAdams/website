# Colophon

This site is a small static site built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). The pages are written in either markdown or nunjucks. I write all of my content in, and develop this website with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

This website's code is stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/MattMcAdams/website) and hosted by [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). Images are optimized with [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) and hosted on [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) for all images.

My domains are all registered through [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/), but I generally use Cloudflare's DNS. For analytics, I use [Plausible](https://plausible.io/).

The typeface used on this website is the lovely [Recursive](https://www.recursive.design/) variable font. It is used for all text including body copy and code snippets.

## Other tools

These weren't strictly used for the creation of this website, but I do use these quite a lot and they remain important to my work.

On a more personal note, I've also written up a list of my personal affects in the form of a [what's in my bag](/objects) style post.
