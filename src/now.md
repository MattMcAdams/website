# Now

A periodically updated, high level overview of what I'm currently doing, experimenting with, learning, reading, or am otherwise interested in.

## Occupation

I am currently working as the Associate Director of Web Strategy at The University of Alabama.

In this role, I handle the day to day operations of our development team, as well as run a community forum centered around web development at the University. My favorite part of my job is helping developers across campus achieve their goals with the products our team creates and maintains.

## Learning

Thanks to work, I'm learning a lot more about WordPress and PHP. The majority of my development work for UA has been in the design system and React component library, but I've wanted to get more familiar with how our WordPress theme works too.

There's a lot of other stuff I'm interested in learning in my own time, some of which I'm actively exploring while others are merely on my radar for exploration in the near future.

Most of these topics are strictly professional development, like getting better at code reviews, devops, and expanding my knowledge into other areas of computer science. Other than tech stuff, I'm brushing up on my fine art skills and am exploring other media like music and sculpture.

## Projects

My current project is building a little home lab. Some other projects I've been working on recently are my [color palette generator](https://colorscale.app), ColorScale, and my [CSS Boilerplate](https://github.com/MattMcAdams/CSS-Boilerplate).

## Down Time

While I'm trying to reduce my screen time, I do still enjoy digital media. Here's a quick list of what I'm into right now.

- Reading: *Foundation* - Isaac Asimov
- Playing: *Oblivion Remastered*
- Watching: *Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts*
- Listening: *Lucy* - Claire Rosinkranz

I've also started drawing again, mostly still life and gesture practices right now.

## Interests

I don't think there's any one thing I'm super interested in at the moment. Maybe just the creative lifestyle, finding a rhythm where I can make stuff without getting burnt out. That's led me to research a lot of different perspectives, time management techniques, and a healthy relationship with the work. I had the privilege of hearing Emonee LaRussa speak on this topic at Adobe Max last October and I think it really got me thinking about my work and creativity in a new perspective.

More in the back of my mind, but I'm still really interested in sustainable and portable technology. I watched a really cool [talk at Strange Loop by Devine Lu Linvega](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3u7bGgVspM) that has had me really inspired. I've been looking into [permacomputing](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/permacomputing.html) as a result of my recent delves into this internet rabbit hole.
